Graphs I can generate with this:

1) Scatter plot with a connnected points 

    Aggregate all of the coloumns based on either 
                        - Median
                        - Average 
                        - 90th Percentile 
                        - 10th Percentile  
                        either 
                        - monthly 
                        - weekly 
                        - daily 
    both options based on users choice 

    defualt graph should be all, then user  can chose which coloumn he wants to display specifically  


    2) A graph with the slider which shows how each of the values as we go thru time; user should be able to define the time 

    3) Create a pie chart for age of device which gives me a percentage of estimate on how many % of devices are how many years old repectively
